                SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
            <p>
                The purpose of this CD is to provide the Content, not the associated software necessary to view the
                Content. The Content of this CD is in HTML for viewing with Microsoft Internet Explorer 4 or newer, and
                uses Microsoft Sound Codecs available in Microsoft's Windows Media Player for Windows or the Macintosh.
                It is your responsibility to correctly install the appropriate Microsoft software for your system.
            <p>
                The text, images, and other media included on this CD ("Content") and their compilation are licensed to
                you subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement by MindView Inc., having a place of business
                at 5343 Valle Vista, La Mesa, CA 91941. Your rights to use other programs and materials included on the
                CD are also governed by separate agreements distributed with those programs and materials on the CD (the
                "Other Agreements"). In the event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and the Other Agreements,
                this Agreement shall govern. By using this CD, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this
                Agreement. MindView Inc. owns title to the Content and to all intellectual property rights therein,
                except insofar as it contains materials that are proprietary to third-party suppliers. All rights in the
                Content except those expressly granted to you in this Agreement are reserved to MindView Inc. and such
                suppliers as their respective interests may appear.
            <p>
                1. LIMITED LICENSE
            <p>
                MindView Inc. grants you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable license to use the Content on a single
                dedicated computer (excluding network servers). This Agreement and your rights hereunder shall
                automatically terminate if you fail to comply with any provisions of this Agreement or any of the Other
                Agreements. Upon such termination, you agree to destroy the CD and all copies of the CD, whether lawful
                or not, that are in your possession or under your control.
            <p>
                2. ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS
            <p>
                a. You shall not (and shall not permit other persons or entities to) directly or indirectly, by
                electronic or other means, reproduce (except for archival purposes as permitted by law), publish,
                distribute, rent, lease, sell, sublicense, assign, or otherwise transfer the Content or any part
                thereof.
            <p>
                b. You shall not (and shall not permit other persons or entities to) use the Content or any part thereof
                for any commercial purpose or merge, modify, create derivative works of, or translate the Content.
            <p>
                c. You shall not (and shall not permit other persons or entities to) obscure MindView's or its suppliers
                copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices or legends from any portion of the Content or any
                related materials.
            </p>
            <p class="web-link">3. PERMISSIONS</p>
            <p class="license-description">
                a. Except as noted in the Contents of the CD, you must treat this software just like a book. However,
                you may copy it onto a computer to be used and you may make archival copies of the software for the sole
                purpose of backing up the software and protecting your investment from loss. By saying, "just like a
                book," MindView, Inc. means, for example, that this software may be used by any number of people and may
                be freely moved from one computer location to another, so long as there is no possibility of its being
                used at one location or on one computer while it is being used at another. Just as a book cannot be read
                by two different people in two different places at the same time, neither can the software be used by
                two different people in two different places at the same time.
            <p>
                b. You may show or demonstrate the unmodified Content in a live presentation, live display, or live web
                site for educational or training purposes. No reproduction, republishing or other use is permitted.
            </p>
