			 I'm Bruce Eckel, and I have worked with Chuck Allison to bring you this
			 Seminar-on-CD ROM, which is being published by my company, MindView, Inc., and
			 included with my books <I>Thinking in C++, 2nd Edition, Volume 1</I> and
			 <I>Thinking in Java, 2nd Edition</I>, both published by
			 Prentice-Hall.</FONT>

				and I believe that this CD ROM Learning Experience will provide you with a
				great value on your educational journey. Although it is designed for people who
				want to learn enough C to move into C++ or Java, you'll find it useful even if
				you would just like an introduction to C. Please note that we are assuming 
				you have already written at least a few small programs in some language; you
				might still get some value from the CD even if you've never programmed before
				but that could require some extra effort at the beginning. You'll know by the
				end of the first lecture and exercises.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica">All the
				lectures on the CD are quite self-explanatory, and the first one describes what
				to expect throughout the course.</FONT></P>

				installation process should be easy and straightforward. Please read the
				following instructions carefully to ensure a pleasant experience in the

				searching for something on the Internet...). For example, you can find a free

				<a href="http://www.borland.com/bcppbuilder/freecompiler/">www.Borland.com</a>.
				Also, The 32-bit

				FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica">. It is not 100% compatible with
				Standard C++ and with what's discussed on the CD, but it's close. Keep in mind
				that the installation and use of free compilers can sometimes be more complex
				than for those that you purchase, so be ready to roll up your sleeves and struggle a
				bit to get them going the first time (unfortunately, we are unable to provide
				support assistance with compiler installations. Please refer to the site where
				you downloaded the compiler or the compiler vendor for such
				support).</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica">There are several

				from </FONT><A HREF="http://java.sun.com"><FONT
				FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica">http://java.sun.com</FONT></A><FONT

			 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica"><STRONG>The sound
				isn't working.</STRONG> You must first download and install the Windows Media
				Player, as in Step 2, above. Once you do that, try locating one of the files on
				the CD (in many subdirectories where the chapter lectures are) ending with
				".asf" and double clicking on it. If the Windows Media Player doesn't start up,
				then there's something wrong with your software installation. If it does and
				you hear no sound (you do have the volume turned up, right?) then there's
				something wrong with your software or hardware installation. We are unable to
				assist you with such problems; you must contact your computer manufacturer or
				support center. You may find the answer at 
				the <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/mediaplayer/">
			  Microsoft media player Web page</A>.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica"><STRONG>Sometimes
				the sound stops working, especially if I'm selecting pages using the index on
				the left-hand side of the screen.</STRONG> This seems to be an "artifact" of
				Internet Explorer, but it also doesn't seem to happen very often. If you just
				shut down the Internet Explorer and start it up again on the same lecture it
				seems to fix the problem. If you have consistent problems and you don't have
				the latest version of Internet Explorer for your platform, you might want to
				install the version provided on this CD, as in Step 1, above.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica"><STRONG>The fonts look bad.</STRONG> 
  			 These documents use standard fonts so if the fonts look bad on screen it's a
  			 problem with your system configuration. However, if you're running Adobe Type
  			 Manager (ATM), it can cause problems if one of the fonts used in the document 
  			 is <i>not</i> in your TrueType list but <i>is</i> in your ATM list of fonts. If this
  			 happens you should either turn off ATM, or install Verdana as a TrueType font
  			 (it is available for free download 
  			 <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/">here</a>).
