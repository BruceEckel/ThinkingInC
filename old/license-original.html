	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica">a. Except as noted in the Contents of the CD, you
		must treat this software just like a book. However, you may copy it onto a
		computer to be used and you may make archival copies of the software for the
		sole purpose of backing up the software and protecting your investment from
		loss. By saying, "just like a book," MindView, Inc. means, for example, that
		this software may be used by any number of people and may be freely moved from
		one computer location to another, so long as there is no possibility of its
		being used at one location or on one computer while it is being used at
		another. Just as a book cannot be read by two different people in two different
		places at the same time, neither can the software be used by two different
		people in two different places at the same time.</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica">b. You may show or demonstrate the unmodified
		Content in a live presentation, live seminar, or live performance as long as
		you attribute all material of the Content to MindView, Inc.</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica">c. Other permissions and grants of rights for use
		of the CD must be obtained directly from MindView, Inc. at

		be liable for any loss, damages, or costs arising from the use of the CD or the
		interpretation of the Content. Some states do not allow exclusion or limitation
		of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or
		consequential damages, so all of the above limitations or exclusions may not
		apply to you.<BR> <BR> In no event shall MindView Inc. or its suppliers' total
		liability to you for all damages, losses, and causes of action (whether in
		contract, tort, or otherwise) exceed the amount paid by you for the
